# WW1-Memorial-Database-Team-7

The Bradford WW1 Group, part of the Bradford Mechanics Institute Lab, requires an SQl database to consolidate its research records contained in 5 spreadsheets into a single system. The database must be locally hosted onto a single Windows laptop and accessed by a frontend web application for data entry, searching, editing and deletion.
Our team sets to do this by completing these key tasks:
- Database Creation, creating and developing the SQL database to store and organise the historical research records.
- Web Interface Development, creating a user-friendly interface for the front end for data entry, search and management.
- Access Control, password protection is being implemented with a Guest user level and Admin user levels to prevent any unauthorised modifications and problems.
- Security Features, with access control is the privileges of the different user levels and guest users are to be restricted to viewing and 
- Integration with Library IT, ensuring that there is compatibility with the existing system from the Mechanics Library
- User Manual, once all 5 key tasks have been completed, an operating guide can then be compiled together for the easy use for the users and for maintenance purposes.

Once all key tasks have been completed, the end result is to have a functional, secure, user-friendly database for WW1 research, for it to be accessible to library members and general public.
Hopefully this database will support the WW1 research of the men and women who served in the military and other war occupations from Bradford and surrounding areas, whilst preserving historical accuracy and data integrity and accessibility.
