As every member of the team needs to contribute to some level of backend for the web application, I need you all to work on one PHP file of the database.

Currently, there are 4 unmodified HTML pages:
- biographies.html
- buried.html
- newspaper.html
- township.html

You need to either change these files into PHP or work on a separate PHP file, whichever you feel is easier. Work on those similar to how I did it in 'memorial.php'.
All these pages share the same database.css file for styling. Don't directly change anything as it could mess up the other pages.

Here is the distribution of the work:
1. Mackenzie - biographies.html [You might have to work with a separate CSS file as you have to display a docx file in the webpage but that's on your judgement]
2. Andrew - buried.html
3. Yousaf - newspaper.html
4. Vankee - township.html

Jawad and Zehao can keep working on the admin side and finish it yourself.

If anyone has any objection or wants any help, let me know on whatsapp.

The code structure reset will be modified after the presentation on Tuesday, and the current structure will be temporarily retained
